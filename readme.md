A collection of useful methods for Arrays, written as prototypes.

Each prototype is written to work standalone, independent of any other code or scripts, and no prototypes rely on the handy new ECMAScript 5 Array prototypes.

(However, /src/aliases/ does contain aliases for ECMAScript 5 Array prototypes because `every`, `some`, and `forEach` are poor name choices.)
