A collection of useful methods for Arrays, written as prototypes.

Each prototype is written to work standalone, independent of any other code or scripts, and no prototypes rely on the handy new ECMAScript 5 Array prototypes.

However, having said that, /src/aliases/ contains aliases for ECMAScript 5 Array prototypes. Why? The names `every`, `some`, and `forEach` are poor choices, which I refuse to accept, especially after, for example, `each` became the defacto standard for `forEach` *before* `forEach` had been codified. You should too. (`</rant>`.)
